  <h3>INTRODUCTION TO R </h3>
  <p>R is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It includes machine learning algorithms, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to name a few. Most of the R libraries are written in R, but for heavy computational tasks, C, C++ and Fortran codes are preferred.
          Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results
  1.Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
2.Transform: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
3.Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
4.Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
5.Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world
</p>
      <h3> WHY PYTHON FOR R</h3>
          <p>R is a  open-source programming languages with a large community. New libraries or tools are added continuously to their respective catalog. R is mainly used for statistical analysis while Python provides a more general approach to data science.
       R is a are state of the art in terms of programming language oriented towards data science. Learning both of them is, of course, the ideal solution. R and Python requires a time-investment, and such luxury is not available for everyone.
             Academics and statisticians have developed R over two decades. R has now one of the richest ecosystems to perform data analysis. There are around 12000 packages available in CRAN (open-source repository). It is possible to find a library for whatever the analysis you want to perform. The rich variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical analysis, especially for specialized analytical work.
    The cutting-edge difference between R and the other statistical products is the output. R has fantastic tools to communicate the results. Rstudio comes with the library knitr. Xie Yihui wrote this package. He made reporting trivial and elegant. Communicating the findings with a presentation or a document is easy.

  <h3>LIBRARIES</h3>
  <P> <H2>THE DIFFERENT LIBRARIES OF PYTHON THAT CAN BE USED FOE AI ARE:</H2>
         <H2> 1. Tensor Flow Python</H2>
  TensorFlow is an end-to-end python machine learning library for performing high-end numerical computations. TensorFlow can handle deep neural networks for image recognition, handwritten digit classification, recurrent neural networks, NLP (Natural Language
 Processing), word embedding and PDE (Partial Differential Equation). TensorFlow Python ensures excellent architecture support to allow easy computation deployments across a wide range of platforms, including desktops, servers, and mobile devices.
 Abstraction is the major benefit of TensorFlow Python towards machine learning and AI projects. This feature allows the developers to focus on comprehensive logic of the app instead of dealing with the mundane details of implementing algorithms. With this library, python developers can now effortlessly leverage AI and ML to create unique responsive applications, which responds to user inputs like facial or voice expression.
 <H2>2. Keras Python</H2>

Keras is a leading open-source Python library written for constructing neural networks and machine learning projects. It can run on Deeplearning4j, MXNet, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Theano or TensorFlow. It offers almost all standalone modules including optimizers, neural layers, activation functions, initialization schemes, cost functions, and regularization schemes. It makes it easy to add new modules just like adding new functions and classes. As the model is already defined in the code, you don’t need to have a separate model config files.
Keras makes it simple for machine learning beginners to design and develop a neural network. Keras Python also deals with convolution neural networks. It includes algorithms for normalization, optimizer, and activation layers. Instead of being an end-to-end Python machine learning library, Keras functions as a user-friendly, extensible interface that enhances modularity & total expressiveness.
